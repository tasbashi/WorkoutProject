# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing a comprehensive frontend authentication system that integrates with the WorkoutProject API. The frontend will handle JWT token management, automatic refresh token mechanism, API client configuration, and React-based authentication flows to provide a seamless user experience for coaches, athletes, and administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a robust API client with standardized response handling, so that I can consistently process all API responses with proper error handling and data formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API client is configured THEN it SHALL handle both authentication responses (direct format) and standard API responses (wrapped format)
2. WHEN an API call succeeds THEN the client SHALL return the response data in the expected format with proper TypeScript typing
3. WHEN an API call fails THEN the client SHALL throw typed errors with appropriate error information and status codes
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the client SHALL provide field-specific error details for form validation
5. WHEN pagination is required THEN the client SHALL include pagination metadata in the response type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user (coach, athlete, admin), I want to authenticate seamlessly through the frontend application, so that I can access my account securely without frequent login interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the frontend SHALL store JWT tokens securely and update the authentication state
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages and prevent login
3. WHEN an access token expires THEN the frontend SHALL automatically attempt to refresh the token without user intervention
4. WHEN token refresh succeeds THEN the frontend SHALL update stored tokens and retry the original request
5. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the frontend SHALL redirect the user to the login page and clear stored tokens
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the frontend SHALL clear all stored tokens and reset the authentication state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to integrate with a test authentication endpoint (GetWeatherForecast), so that I can verify the authentication flow is working correctly during development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WeatherForecast component calls the API without authentication THEN it SHALL display an authentication error message
2. WHEN the WeatherForecast component calls the API with valid JWT token THEN it SHALL display the weather forecast data
3. WHEN the WeatherForecast component calls the API with expired token THEN it SHALL automatically refresh the token and retry the request
4. WHEN token refresh fails during the API call THEN it SHALL redirect the user to login and display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN it SHALL display the weather data in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to implement role-based access control, so that users can only access UI components and routes appropriate to their role (Admin, Trainer, Athlete).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the frontend SHALL store the user's role and permissions from the authentication response
2. WHEN a protected route is accessed THEN the frontend SHALL verify the user's role before rendering the component
3. WHEN a user attempts to access unauthorized routes THEN the frontend SHALL redirect them to an appropriate page or show an access denied message
4. WHEN role-based UI elements are rendered THEN the frontend SHALL only display components the user is authorized to see
5. WHEN API calls require specific roles THEN the frontend SHALL include proper authorization headers and handle 403 responses gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious frontend application, I want secure token storage and management, so that user sessions are protected against common client-side security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing access tokens THEN the frontend SHALL keep them in memory or secure storage to prevent XSS attacks
2. WHEN storing refresh tokens THEN the frontend SHALL use the most secure storage available (httpOnly cookies preferred, secure localStorage as fallback)
3. WHEN tokens are transmitted THEN the frontend SHALL only send them over HTTPS connections
4. WHEN access tokens are near expiration THEN the frontend SHALL proactively refresh them before they expire
5. WHEN refresh tokens expire THEN the frontend SHALL clear all stored tokens and redirect to login
6. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the frontend SHALL clear all tokens and force re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript types and interfaces, so that I can integrate with all API endpoints with full type safety and IntelliSense support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API types are defined THEN they SHALL include all request and response interfaces with proper TypeScript typing
2. WHEN authentication types are created THEN they SHALL clearly define the structure of login, refresh, and user data
3. WHEN error types are defined THEN they SHALL include all possible error response formats with proper typing
4. WHEN API client methods are implemented THEN they SHALL return properly typed responses with generic support
5. WHEN types change THEN they SHALL be updated consistently across all related components and services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want automatic token refresh capability, so that I don't experience authentication interruptions during normal usage of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token is near expiration THEN the frontend SHALL automatically initiate a refresh request in the background
2. WHEN a refresh request is made THEN the frontend SHALL update both access and refresh tokens in storage
3. WHEN multiple API calls occur during token refresh THEN the frontend SHALL queue them and retry after refresh completes
4. WHEN token refresh fails due to network issues THEN the frontend SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN token refresh fails permanently THEN the frontend SHALL clear all tokens, show a re-authentication message, and redirect to login
